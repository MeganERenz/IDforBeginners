    "\n",
    "### Gram-Schmidt\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear algebra, we usually learn about the Gram-Schmidt method to orthonormalize vectors.  This method treats the columns of $A$ as a set of vectors to orthonormalize in order to get a QR factorization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first step of the Gram-Schmidt process, we select the first column and normalize it.  This becomes the first column in our $Q$, and the norm of the first column becomes the top left value in the $R$ that we are constructing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ A= \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{A_{:,1}}{||A_{:,1}||} & ... \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} ||A_{:,1}||&...\\\\ 0 &\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want the next column in $Q$ to be orthonormal to the first, so we take the next column in $A$, subtract off the part that is not orthogonal to the first column, and then normalize it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second column in $Q$ becomes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_{:,2}=\\frac{A_{:,2}-(A_{:,2}*Q_{:,1})Q_{:,1}}{||A_{:,2}-(A_{:,2}*Q_{:,1})Q_{:,1}||}$\n",

    "\n",
    "$R= \\begin{bmatrix} ||A_{:,1}||& A_{:,2} Q_{:,1} & ...\\\\ 0 & A_{:,2} Q_{:,2}& ... \\\\ 0 &0\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is iterative. For each subsequent step, we start with the next column of $A$, and then we orthogonalize it to all of the existing columns of $Q$ by subtracting off the parts of the column that are not orthogonal to each of the columns.  We then write $R$ so that we can recover $A$.    \n",

    "### Rank-Revealing QR (Bussinger and Golub 1965)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The way to find the interpolative decomposition (the reason we went through all of the above) is by finding a rank-revealing QR factorization. The method that we use to find a rank-revealing QR factorization is called column-pivoted QR.  This is the same algorithm as the Gram-Schmidt method, except at each step we choose the largest remaining column, and \"pivot\" it (move it) to the \"working vector\" that we are orthogonalizing to the columns in $Q$.  We keep track of where the columns go by using a permutation matrix.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of $A=QR$, we get $A=QR\\Pi^T$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is also readily available in scipy. Note that $\\Pi$ is not returned in matrix form, but is instead a list of indices to save space.  If $\\Pi$ were [2 1 3 0], that means we put the third column in the first position, the second column in the second position, etc.\n",
